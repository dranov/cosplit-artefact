# eth-usage-analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook associated with an analysis of Ethereum usage I wrote. To run correctly, the notebook needs either:

* a Parity node synced with the `--tracing=on` option available at `JSONRPC_ENDPOINT` **OR**
* the dataset dump available via IPFS at `QmXJCZEiZh2Hs7xGTojtbWoJcMqFr751HW6Ubvk1M6rHHs` (same as `eth-usage-dataset.zip`)
