# CoSplit artefact - PLDI21 paper 885

## Getting Started Guide

The artefact consists of a virtual machine image.

Download VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

We used version 6.1.18


The login details are user 'pldi21' with password 'pldi21' (without quotes).

**Common problems and how to fix them**:

- The Virtual Box display window becomes black. This sometimes happens on
  high-resolution monitors. When it happens, simply resize the Virtual Box
  window (by dragging from the corner). The VM display should become functional
  again.

- I cannot unzip `eth-usage-dataset.zip`. Use `7za x eth-usage-dataset.zip`
  rather than the `unzip` command.
